          Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Lauren and I've made this page to show you a little bit of
          who I am. Have a look at what makes me tick in my Bio (don't be afraid to reach out for a recipe!),
          explore my work and education on my Experience page, and delve into my coding projects in my Portfolio.
